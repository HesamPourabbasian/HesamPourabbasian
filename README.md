# 👋 Hi, I'm Hesam

I'm a Computer Science student based in Tabriz, Iran. I started my journey in web development focusing on the frontend side — building responsive interfaces and working with web technologies. However, I quickly realized that my real passion wasn’t in UI design or visual aesthetics.

🔄 So, I shifted gears!  
These days, I'm diving into the world of backend development. I'm currently learning **Python** and **Django**, aiming to build robust and scalable web applications with clean, maintainable code.

## 🧠 What I'm learning now
- Python 🐍
- Django 🌐
- Backend architecture
- Databases & APIs

## 📌 Goals
- Master backend web development with Django
- Build full-stack personal projects
- Contribute to open-source Python/Django communities
